# Bloggr - a react-redux powered blogging website 
***

surge deployed at `bloggr-redux.surge.sh`

### Requirements fulfilled: 

The website has all the listed requirements, i.e. mentioned routes, CRUD API calls, etc.


### What I did: 

The goal of creating this website was to gain even more experience using `React`, while gainaing experience with `Redux` as a global read-only store of state. It was fun, and I personally enjoyed working around some of the more subtle aspects of the task at hand. Particularly interesting was using `middleware` and `thunks` -- they do indeed seem very powerful, and I would be interested to see what other applications they may have. 


### What worked / what didn't work:

Most things seemed to work. I am, though, interested in seeing how exactly one would implement error handling within the structure of our current axios calls. I did not implement said extra credit. 


## Extra Credit: 

- ***style*** : visible upon visiting website; extensive CSS and transitions used. 
- ***input validation***: user is not allowed to enter non-valid values (i.e. empty fields for `Title`, `Tags`, `Content` fields) for already created posts.
